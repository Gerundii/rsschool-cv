### About me

Not so long ago, I felt for myself what emotional burnout is. As a way out of this situation, I decided to change my field of activity.

The solution lay on the surface - IT.
Why did I decide to start developing in this direction:
- everything you need is always at hand - my laptop and the Internet;
- a lot of people who are open to communication on various topics, ready to give advice and share life experiences;
- a huge number of relevant sources of information for self-education;    
- any tool needed for development, testing, etc., can be tried instantly.

I quickly assimilate information that is interesting to me, quickly master the necessary tools. I love to learn new things and apply it in practice. Teamwork gives me great pleasure.
